## Motivation

When rendering a large set of data (e.g. list, table etc.) in React, we all face performance/memory troubles. There're [some great libraries](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react%20virtualized) already available but most of them are component-based solutions that increase a lot of bundle size for our app(s). However [a library](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react-virtual) comes out as a hook-based solution, but applying styles for using it can be verbose. In addition, it doesn't support TypeScript and lack of some useful features like [real-time dynamic size](#TBC), [RWD](#TBC), [infinite scroll](#TBC), and related event callbacks etc.

React Cool Virtual is a [tiny size](https://bundlephobia.com/result?p=react-cool-virtual) but [feature-rich](#features) library, which supplies you a better DX and modern way for virtualizing a large amount of data without struggle üò≠.

## Getting Started

To use React Cool Virtual, you must use `react@16.8.0` or greater which includes hooks.

### Installation

This package is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-cool-virtual).

```sh
$ yarn add react-cool-virtual
# or
$ npm install --save react-cool-virtual
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This package using [ResizeObserver API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resize_Observer_API) under the hook. [Most modern browsers support it natively](https://caniuse.com/?search=ResizeObserver), you can also add [polyfill](#resizeobserver-polyfill) for full browser support.

### CDN

If you're not using a module bundler or package manager. We also provide a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) build which is available over the [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com) CDN. Simply use a `<script>` tag to add it after [React CND links](https://reactjs.org/docs/cdn-links.html) as below:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<!-- react-cool-virtual comes here -->
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-cool-virtual/dist/index.umd.production.min.js"></script>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Once you've added this you will have access to the `window.ReactCoolVirtual.useVirtual` variable.

### Basic Usage

Here's the basic concept of how it rocks:

```js
import useVirtual from "react-cool-virtual";

const List = () => {
  const { outerRef, innerRef, items } = useVirtual({
    itemCount: 50000, // (Required) The total number of items in the list
    itemSize: 100, // The size of an item (default = 50)
  });

  return (
    <div
      ref={outerRef} // (Required) Set the scroll container with the `outerRef`
      style={{ width: "300px", height: "500px", overflow: "auto" }}
    >
      {/* (Required) Set the inner element with the `innerRef` */}
      <div ref={innerRef}>
        {items.map(({ index, size }) => (
          // You can set the item's height with the `size` property
          <div key={index} style={{ height: `${size}px` }}>
            Row {index}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

‚ú® Pretty easy right? React Cool Virtual is more powerful than you think. Let's explore more use cases through the examples!

## Examples

## Performance Optimization

## How to Sharing A `ref`?

You can share a `ref` as follows, here we take the `outerRef` as the example:

```js
import { useRef } from "react";
import useVirtual from "react-cool-virtual";

const App = () => {
  const ref = useRef();
  const { outerRef } = useVirtual();

  return (
    <div
      ref={(el) => {
        outerRef.current = el; // Set the element to the `outerRef`
        ref.current = el; // Share the element for other purposes
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

## Working in TypeScript

React Cool Virtual is built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), you can tell the hook what type of your **outer** and **inner** elements are as follows:

```tsx
import useVirtual from "react-cool-virtual";

const App = () => {
  // 1st is the `outerRef`, 2nd is the `innerRef`
  const { outerRef, innerRef } = useVirtual<HTMLDivElement, HTMLDivElement>();

  return (
    <div ref={outerRef}>
      <div ref={innerRef}>{/* Rendering items... */}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

üí° For more available types, please [check it out](src/types/react-cool-virtual.d.ts).

## API

Coming soon...

## ResizeObserver Polyfill

[ResizeObserver has good support amongst browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=ResizeObserver), but it's not universal. You'll need to use polyfill for browsers that don't support it. Polyfills is something you should do consciously at the application level. Therefore React Cool Virtual doesn't include it.

We recommend using [@juggle/resize-observer](https://github.com/juggle/resize-observer):

```sh
$ yarn add @juggle/resize-observer
# or
$ npm install --save @juggle/resize-observer
```

Then pollute the `window` object:

```js
import { ResizeObserver } from "@juggle/resize-observer";

if (!("ResizeObserver" in window)) window.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserver;
```

You could use dynamic imports to only load the file when the polyfill is required:

```js
(async () => {
  if (!("ResizeObserver" in window)) {
    const module = await import("@juggle/resize-observer");
    window.ResizeObserver = module.ResizeObserver;
  }
})();
```

## To Do...

- [ ] Unit testing
- [ ] Reverse scrolling
- [ ] Infinite loop
- [ ] `scrollBy` method
