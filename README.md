## ResizeObserver Polyfill

[ResizeObserver has good support amongst browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver), but it's not universal. You'll need to use polyfill for browsers that don't support it. Polyfills is something you should do consciously at the application level. Therefore `react-cool-virtual` doesn't include it.

We recommend using [@juggle/resize-observer](https://github.com/juggle/resize-observer):

```sh
$ yarn add @juggle/resize-observer
# or
$ npm install --save @juggle/resize-observer
```

Then pollute the `window` object:

```js
import { ResizeObserver } from "@juggle/resize-observer";

if (!("ResizeObserver" in window)) window.ResizeObserver = ResizeObserver;
```

You could use dynamic imports to only load the file when the polyfill is required:

```js
(async () => {
  if (!("ResizeObserver" in window)) {
    const module = await import("@juggle/resize-observer");
    window.ResizeObserver = module.ResizeObserver;
  }
})();
```
